Plot the curve by using the Matlab.

WHY?
It's the first time that I try to use the github. So the rository which is called Curveplot is an test.
But it is also able to run on the Matlab platform and some functions can be implemented.

WHAT?
This repository includes two files:CruveF.m and data.txt.
data.txt incldes the position of scattered pots .
CurveF.m is the script of Matlab which plot the chart.
